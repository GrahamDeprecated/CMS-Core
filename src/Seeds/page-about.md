## THIS ALPHA RELEASE IS FOR TESTING ONLY

#### I'd appreciate it if you'd leave my name in the footer unless you have changed my source significantly. If you do feel you have changed it significantly, I'd still appreciate some kind of link back. Thank you, and enjoy!

## What Is Bootstrap CMS?

Bootstrap CMS is a PHP CMS powered by [Laravel 4.0](http://laravel.com) with [Sentry 2.0](http://docs.cartalyst.com/sentry-2).  

* Bootstrap CMS was created by, and is maintained by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell).  
* Bootstrap CMS uses [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS) to run tests to check if it's working as it should.  
* Bootstrap CMS uses [Scrutinizer CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS) to run additional tests and checks.  
* Bootstrap CMS uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to load and manage dependencies.  
* Bootstrap CMS provides a [change log](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [releases](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/releases), and a [wiki](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/wiki).  
* Bootstrap CMS is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3, available [here](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/blob/master/LICENSE.md).  
* Licenses for included components are available [here](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS/tree/master/licenses), excluding [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed components.  

<br>

## What Does Testing Release Mean?

Basically, expect no support what so ever. This includes, but is not exclusive to:  

* No support or help will be given during installation or updating.  
  * No database migration support between updates
  * Updates may not be backwards compatible
* Some of the config may be for features that don't exist yet.  
  * Some config may even brake the entire site
  * Just remember, this software comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY
* Technically, this software comes with no support after the testing stage either.  
  * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  * See the [GNU Affero General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) for more details

## System Requirements

Bootstrap CMS was designed to run on a Linux machine with PHP 5.4 and MySQL 5.5.  

* PHP 5.4.7+ or PHP 5.5+ is required.
* MySQL 5.1+, 5.5+, or 5.6+ is required. MySQL 5.7+ may work, but is untested.  
* You will need [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed to load the dependencies of Bootstrap CMS.  
* You will need to configure the site in the app/config folder before production.  
* Some features require a cache server like [Redis](http://redis.io) and a queuing server like [Beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd).  

<br>

## Installation

Please check the system requirements before installing Bootstrap CMS.  

1. You may install by cloning from github, or via composer.  
  * Github: `git clone git@github.com:GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS.git`
  * Composer: `composer create-project graham-campbell/bootstrap-cms --prefer-dist`
2. From a command line open in the folder, run `composer install`.  
3. Enter your database details into `app/config/databse.php`.  
4. Run `php artisan app:install` to setup and seed your database.  
5. You will need to enter your mail server details into `app/config/mail.php`.  
  * You can disable verification emails on registration in `app/config/cms.php`
  * Mail is still required for other functions like password resets
  * I'd recommend [queuing](#setting-up-queing) email sending for greater performance (see below)
6. Finally, setup an [Apache VirtualHost](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/examples.html) to point to the "public" folder.
  * For development, you can simply run `php artisan serve`
7. Additionally, you may to setup some of Bootstrap CMS's other features (see below).  
  * Some things, like [caching](#setting-up-caching) and [queuing](#setting-up-queing), are disabled out of the box
  * This is to allow Bootstrap CMS to work with minimal setup

<br>

## Setting Up Queuing

Note that `beanstalkd` requires a local server, while `sqs` and `iron` are cloud based.  

1. Choose your poison - I'd recommend [IronMQ](http://www.iron.io/mq).  
2. Enter your queuing server details into `app/config/queue.php`.  
3. You can also set a separate mail queue in `app/config/mail.php`.  
4. For [IronMQ](http://www.iron.io/mq), the queue subscription path is `/queue/receive`.  
5. You can find out more about queuing by heading over to the [Laravel Docs](http://laravel.com/docs/queues).  

<br>

## Setting Up Caching

Note that caching will not work with Laravel's `file` or `database` cache drivers.  

1. Choose your poison - I'd recommend [Redis](http://redis.io).  
2. Enter your cache server details into `app/config/cache.php`.  
3. Enable Bootstrap CMS's caching in `app/config/cms.php`.  

<br>

## Setting Up Analytics

Bootstrap CMS natively supports [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) (other services to come later).  

1. Setup a web property on [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).  
2. Enter your tracking id into `app/config/analytics.php`.  
3. Enable Google Analytics in `app/config/analytics.php`.  

<br>

## Setting Up Themes

Bootstrap CMS also ships with 13 themes from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/2).  

1. You can set your theme in `app/config/theme.php`.  
2. You can also set your nav bar style in `app/config/theme.php`.  
3. After making theme changes, you will have to run `php artisan app:update`.

## Updating Your Fork

The latest and greatest source can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS).  
Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.  

You may fork Bootstrap CMS:  

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).  

You can then update the branch:  

    git pull --rebase upstream develop
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.  

<br>

## Pull Requests

Please submit pull requests against the develop branch.  

* Any pull requests made against the master branch will be closed immediately.  
* If you plan to fix a bug, please create a branch called `fix-`, followed by an appropriate name.  
* If you plan to add a feature, please create a branch called `feature-`, followed by an appropriate name.  
* Please indent with 4 spaces rather than tabs, and make sure your code is commented.
